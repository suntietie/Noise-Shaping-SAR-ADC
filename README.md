# Design of Analog-to Digital Converter Based on Noise Shaping Technology

Design noise-shaping SAR ADC model using Simulink. An internal circuit-level DAC is used to introduce non-ideal 
factors of SAR ADC. Simulation shows that under the sampling rate of 20MS/s and oversampling rate of 4, 
the ideal first-order and second-order noise shaping is 1.1 bits and 0.77 bits higher than the original ADC. 
For the non-ideal 2nd-order noise shaping diagram designed in this paper, ENOB is improved by 1.73 bits compared 
with the original ADC under the sampling rate of 30MS/s, oversampling rate of 8, adding sample-and-hold 
circuit & noise shaping circuit capacitance noise.
